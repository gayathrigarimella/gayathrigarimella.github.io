Welcome!
======
I am an undergraduate student, currently in my fifth year(10th Semester) of the Integrated Master's program at the International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore. 

My research interests are in the field of theoretical Cryptography focusing on primitives used to realize Secure Multi-Party Computation. More specifically, I am working on variants of the Byzantine Agreement primitive and realizing MPC on the more realistic asynchronous network which will lead to my Final year(Master's) thesis. In general, I am passionate about theoretical computer science.

 I feel privileged to be introduced and guided on my journey with Cryptography by Prof. Ashish Choudhury at IIIT-B. Further, visiting Cris Lab, IISc and working with Prof. Arpita Patra continues to be a great learning experience.
