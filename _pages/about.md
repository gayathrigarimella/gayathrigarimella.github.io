Welcome!
======
I am a third year PhD student at Oregon State University studying computer science. I am part of the Advanced Research in Cryptography group and advised by Professor Mike Rosulek. My research interests are in the field of theoretical Cryptography focusing on primitives used to realize Secure Multi-Party Computation.  In general, I am passionate about theoretical computer science.

I completed my undergraduation and graduation (dual degree) at the International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore(IIIT-B) in 2018 in Computer Science with specialization in Theoretical Computer Science. I was guided on my journey with Cryptography by Prof. Ashish Choudhury from IIIT-B and was a regular visitor at CRiS Lab at Indian Institue of Science(IISc) and working with Prof. Arpita Patra was a great learning experience.
